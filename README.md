# Description of Data

The CPS, the Current Population Survey, is a monthly government survey
of American households whose primary task is to inquire about income and
employment.There are 133,710 persons in this dataset. Persons of all
ages are included. The survey universe is people living in the US in a
household, so institutional populations (dorms, prisons, barracks,
shelters) are not included. If you weight by perwt\_rounded, you should
get up to the non institutional US population in 2000. For some
variables, like income and education, the children in the dataset have
missing
    values.
