# What happened?

## Session 1

Before the first session, students followed the installation
instructions below.

You can find a screencast of the first session
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezerknbEDKw). You can also find a
written summary
[here](https://github.com/stenhaug/stanfordsoc382/blob/master/written-summaries/summary_of_session_1.md).

We started the first session by laughing about a few fantastic language
wars tweets:

    you](https://twitter.com/DavidAJaeger/status/1092755742950604800)
